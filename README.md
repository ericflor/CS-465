# CS-465 Full Stack Web Application

This repository contains a working full stack web application that serves both the customer and administrative sides of the application. In the final iteration, security features were added to the admin login to ensure secure login authentication. This README file reflects on the entire process of building the project.

## Architecture

In this full stack project, multiple frontend development technologies were used. Express was utilized for building the backend server, handling API endpoints, and serving HTML templates. HTML and JavaScript were used for rendering and manipulating the user interface on the client-side. Additionally, a single-page application (SPA) approach was adopted using Angular for creating a seamless and responsive user experience.

The backend used a NoSQL MongoDB database for several reasons. NoSQL databases like MongoDB offer high scalability and flexibility, making them suitable for handling large amounts of unstructured data. They allow for easy schema modifications and can handle complex and evolving data structures. The document-oriented nature of MongoDB also aligns well with the JSON data format, making it efficient for storing and retrieving JSON-based data.

## Functionality

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a data interchange format that is independent of any programming language. It is derived from JavaScript syntax and provides a lightweight and human-readable way to represent structured data. In this full stack project, JSON is used as the standard data format for communication between the frontend and backend. JavaScript is the language used on the frontend for client-side logic and manipulation of the JSON data received from the backend.

Throughout the development process, code refactoring was performed to improve functionality and efficiencies. One key aspect was the use of reusable user interface (UI) components. By creating modular and reusable components, code duplication was minimized, leading to cleaner code and improved maintainability. Benefits of reusable UI components include faster development, consistent user experience, and easier bug fixing and updates.

## Testing

Testing in a full stack application involves various aspects, including API testing, endpoint testing, and security testing. API testing ensures that the API endpoints function correctly and return the expected responses. This can involve unit testing of individual API methods and integration testing to verify the interaction between the frontend and backend.

Endpoint testing focuses on testing specific API endpoints to validate their behavior and functionality. This includes testing different request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and ensuring proper handling of request payloads and responses. Security testing is crucial, especially for sensitive operations like login authentication. It involves testing the security measures in place, such as password hashing, session management, and access control.
